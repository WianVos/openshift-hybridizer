The https://www.ansible.com[Ansible] scripts that can be used to provision an **Hybrid Cloud Environment** and generate the required https://www.ansible.com[Ansible] scripts to deploy **All In One** OpenShift cluster on to it.

[NOTE]
=====
Currently supported **Cloud Providers**:

* Azure(**azr**)
* Amazon(**aws**) 
* Google Cloud Platform (**gcp**)

=====

== Sources

The sources of these scripts can be downloaded from  {uri-repo}#[GitHub].

Lets clone the sources `git clone {uri-repo}` to a directory on local file system.  For convenience we shall refer to the sources clone directory as `$PROJECT_HOME`.

== Pre-Requisites

* `Docker` installed and available locally, based on your environment have native docker for linux or https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/[Docker for Mac] or https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/[Docker for Windows] installed

* Refer to the following documentation on what are the pre-requisites for each Cloud Provider that are currently supported:

** AWS   - https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.5/scenario_guides/guide_aws.html

** Azure - https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.5/scenario_guides/guide_azure.html

** Google Cloud Platform -   
   https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.5/scenario_guides/guide_gce.html

[[container-installer]]
== Installer Image

The installer image is built from {uri-ansible}[Ansible Runner] with need Ansible Cloud modules which are required to provision the cloud resources. The provisioned Cloud resources can then be used to deploy **All In One** OpenShift cluster.

The installer image is available at `{uri-docker-hca}`, to pull it run the command:

[source,sh,subs=attributes+]
----
$ docker pull {uri-docker-hca}
----

== Create Hybrid Cloud Instances

=== Preparation 

Rename `$PROJECT_HOME/env/extravars.example` to `$PROJECT_HOME/env/extravars`, this file will be used to configure your cloud keys and other ansible facts. 

The following Cloud Provider specific sections will detail more on the variables that can defined in `extravars`.

NOTE: The `$PROJECT_HOME/env/extravars` follows YAML convention.

[cols=".<1,.<4,.<4,<5"]
|===
|Variable Name |Description |  Default value |  Example

| clouds | The public cloud(s)where to provision| Currently supported values are azr, aws and gcp.
a| 
[source,yaml]
----
clouds:
 - gcp
 - azr
 - aws
----

The example configures provisioning of two clouds Azure and Google Cloud Platform

|instance_name | The compute instance name that will be assigned |  openshift-all-in-one |  

|gcp_rollback | Delete all Google Cloud Platform resources that were provisioned  |  False |  

|azure_rollback | Delete all Azure resources that were provisioned  |  False | 

|aws_rollback | Delete all Amazon Web Services resources that were provisioned  |  False |

==== Azure
include::{includedir}/azr_vars.adoc[leveloffset: +1]

==== Google Cloud 
include::{includedir}/gcp_vars.adoc[leveloffset: +1]

== Provisioning 

The provisioning consists of two parts:

 - Provision Cloud Resources
 - Deploying OpenShift 

[[prov-cloud-resource]]
=== Cloud Resources

[source,sh,subs=attributes+]
----
$ ./provision.sh 
----

== DeProvisioning 

The undeploying of Cloud Resources are controlled by three main variables that are defined in `env/extravars`

[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
gcp_rollback: False {conum-guard-sh}<1>
azure_rollback: False {conum-guard-sh}<2>
aws_rollback: False {conum-guard-sh} <3>
----

<1> Set to `True` to undeploy GCP resources
<2> Set to `True` to undeploy Azure resources
<3> Set to `True` to undeploy AWS resources

[source,sh]
----
$ ./deprovision.sh 
----

[[deploy-openshift]]
== Deploy OpenShift

After successful provisioning of <<prov-cloud-resource>>, there should be one directory per cloud created under `$PROJECT_HOME/out`. 

e.g. The following shows the directory tree for Azure and GCP
[source,sh,subs=attributes+]
----
 out
   |-azr
   |---inventory <1>
   |-----host_vars <2>
   |- connect.sh <3>
   |- host_prepare.yaml <4>
   |- deploy.sh <5>
   |- docker-storage-setup <6>
   |-gcp
   |---inventory
   |-----host_vars
   |- connect.sh
   |- host_prepare.yaml
   |- deploy.sh
   |- docker-storage-setup
----

<1> The cloud specific Ansible Inventory directory
<2> host_vars, the Ansible host variables  for the cloud provider
<3> The SSH connect utility, this has the IP address of the OpenShift
<4> The Cloud Host OpenShift Deployment preparation tasks
<5> The OpenShift Deploy script
<6> The Docker storage setup file

e.g. Lets say you want to deploy OpenShit on to your Google Cloud Platform(gcp), run the following command:

[source,sh]
----
$ cd $PROJECT_HOME/out/gcp
$ ./deploy.sh 
----
